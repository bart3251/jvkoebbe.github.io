# Website for Joe Koebbe,
### Department of Mathematics and Statistics at USU

This site is maintained to offer people access to applications I have written over the past years. There are a lot of codes that 
I have written in a variety of languages. For example, I wrote a basic black oil simulator for my dissertation many years ago on
a pair of DEC VAX machines at the Univerisity of Wyoming in Fortran 77. Another project involves the simulation of the Gambler's
Ruin problem written in Java.
